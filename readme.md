## Introduction
Number plate detection is an important task in various applications such as traffic surveillance, parking management, and law enforcement. This project utilizes the YOLO algorithm, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to detect number plates in images or videos. Gradio, a Python library, is used to create a simple and interactive user interface for easy testing and deployment.
